# CMSI-298-LeetCode-Projects

This was made during my Freshman Year, Second Semester (Spring 2021).

- Here are the leetcode interview questions/answers that we went over for class. Please ignore the one with the Python extension as I was practicing with Professor Toal in setting up my repo and practicing with knowing Git/GitHub in general.
  - Reverse-Int.js = Reverse Integar
  - subarray.js = Maximum Average Subarray I
  - fizzbuzz.js = FizzBuzz Problem
  - removeduplicates.js = Remove Duplicates from Subarray
  - lengthlastword.js = Length of Last Word
